CircleApp
=========

Simple iOS example with coloured bubbles and animations

It demonstrates some of the iOS API features such as 
* UIView Animations
* CoreGrpahics Layers
* UIView Touch Delegate
* Simple network requests and JSON parsing.

There should be no issues compiling and running under XCODE.

It has been developed and tested against the iOS8 SDK, 
however compilcation and execution should be available from iOS 5 onwards in theory, 
but most likely the XCode project isn't compatible, however the busines logic and view controllers are.
